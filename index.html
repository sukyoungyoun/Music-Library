            <b>Music Library</b> is a generative, data-driven design project that explores the complexities of memory and identity through my personal relationship with music. This project reflects my search to understand how personal data influences my self-conception, particularly in the context of my musical history. As I engaged with my musical data, I realized that music is not just a collection of songs; it serves as a rich tapestry of memories, emotions, and experiences that shape who I am. Each track evokes a different moment, a different feeling, creating an abstract yet deeply personal narrative. This project seeks to visualize that complexity, transforming raw data into interactive representations that invite reflection and exploration.
